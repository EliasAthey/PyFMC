# Overview
This is an implementation of [Fractal AI's Fractal Monte Carlo (FMC) algorithm](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1803/1803.05049.pdf). It can be used for reinforcement learning where states are n real numbers.

Unlike most RL approaches, where an agent takes actions in an environment. I am approaching the problem where the environment and the agent and synonymous. "Actions" are changes to the system and constraints on those changes influence what "actions" are allowed.
